# Quantum Stepping Stones

This repository is meant to document my learning of Quantum Error Correction through coding exercises.

Learners who have a grasp of basic quantum information theory can use it to complement their own learning journey.

**Update**:</b> I am developing this into a web app made using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). This is a work in progress, which aims to create a  set of interactive learning exercises to help understand Quantum Error Correction.
