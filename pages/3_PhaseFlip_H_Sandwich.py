### üå± What about phase errors?
Up to now, we've only worried about **bit flips**, which are errors that swap $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$.  
But quantum systems also suffer **phase flips**, described by the Pauli-$Z$ operator:

$$ Z\ket{0} = \ket{0}, \qquad Z\ket{1} = -\ket{1}. $$

For the pure state $\ket{1}$, that minus sign is just a **global phase** (invisible on its own).  
But for a **superposition**, like

$$ \ket{+} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(\ket{0}+\ket{1}\big), $$
a $Z$ error turns it into

$$ \ket{-} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\big). $$

Now the relative phase between components has changed - and this is physically observable if you measure in the right basis.

---

### The trick: switch bases
If we want to treat phase flips just like bit flips, we can **rotate the basis** using Hadamards:
- Apply $H$ before the noise: $Z$ errors become $X$-like.
- Apply $H$ after the noise: rotate back.

This ‚ÄúH-sandwich‚Äù lets us reuse the same 3-qubit bit-flip code to also protect against phase errors.

---

### Encoding the phase-flip code
The logical states are:

$$ \ket{0_L} = \ket{+ + +}, \qquad \ket{1_L} = \ket{- - -}. $$

The stabilizers we measure are $X$-type:
- $X_1 X_2$
- $X_2 X_3$

If a single $Z$ error occurs, the syndrome identifies which qubit flipped in phase.

---

### Example
- If qubit 1 suffers a $Z$ error, the $X_1X_2$ stabilizer anticommutes and signals it.  
- If qubit 2 suffers a $Z$ error, both checks flip.  
- If qubit 3 suffers a $Z$ error, only $X_2X_3$ detects it.  

The decoder then applies $Z$ on the identified qubit to restore the logical state.

---

### Activity
To really *see* what a phase flip does, let's look at a single qubit in the lab:

1. Prepare the state $\ket{+}$.  
2. With probability $p$, apply a $Z$ error.  
3. Measure either in the **Z basis** or the **X basis**.  

- In the Z basis, the counts don't change, the phase error is invisible here.  
- In the X basis, the error flips $\ket{+}\mapsto\ket{-}$, and you'll see outcome ‚Äú1‚Äù appear with probability $\approx p$.  

This small experiment shows why the H-sandwich works: it rotates phase errors into a basis where they become **measurable bit flips**.

---

### What you can do below
1. Use the sliders to set the error probability $p$ and number of shots.  
2. Run the simulation in Z basis and then X basis.  
3. Compare the bar charts and circuits to see when the phase error shows up.  

---

### Challenge
Try $p=0.3$ with 5000 shots.  
- In the Z basis: the counts barely move from 50/50.  
- In the X basis: you should see roughly 70% ‚Äú0‚Äù and 30% ‚Äú1‚Äù, revealing the phase flips directly.  

This activity bridges the intuition from abstract stabilizers to something you can **observe and play with**.
