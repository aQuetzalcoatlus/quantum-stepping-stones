    ### Welcome to the Quantum Error Correction Lab
    Every time we send or store information there is a chance it will get corrupted.  
    For ordinary computers this means a bit can flip from `0` to `1`.  
    We use simple tricks like parity checks and repetition to catch and fix those flips.

    In the quantum world there is more to worry about.  
    Qubits can flip between $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$.  
    They can also pick up **phase** changes that are invisible if you only look in the computational basis.  
    Measuring a qubit can destroy the very information you want to protect.  
    So the question is simple. How do we keep quantum information safe without looking at it directly?

    This lab is a guided set of small experiments.  
    You will read a short idea, try an interactive activity, and then answer a tiny challenge that you can solve by adjusting the sliders.

    ---

    Think of this as an interactive textbook.
    Enjoy the experiments!
